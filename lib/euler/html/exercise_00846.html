<p>
A <i>bracelet</i> is made by connecting at least three numbered beads in a circle. Each bead can only display $1$, $2$, or any number of the form $p^k$ or $2p^k$ for odd prime $p$.</p>

<p>
In addition a <i>magic bracelet</i> must satisfy the following two conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li> no two beads display the same number</li>
<li> the product of the numbers of any two adjacent beads is of the form $x^2+1$</li>
</ul>

<p>
Define the <i>potency</i> of a magic bracelet to be the sum of numbers on its beads. </p>
<p>
The example is a magic bracelet with five beads which has a potency of 155. </p>

<p>
Let $F(N)$ be the sum of the potency of each magic bracelet which can be formed using positive integers not exceeding $N$, where rotations and reflections of an arrangement are considered equivalent. You are given $F(20)=258$ and $F(10^2)=538768$.</p>

<p>
Find $F(10^6)$.</p>
