Problem 207:

For some positive integers k, there exists an integer partition of the form 4^t = 2^t + k,
where 4^t, 2^t, and k are all positive integers and t is a real number.

The first two such partitions are 4^1 = 2^1 + 2 and 4^{1.5849625\cdots} = 2^{1.5849625\cdots} + 6.

Partitions where t is also an integer are called perfect. 
For any m \ge 1 let P(m) be the proportion of such partitions that are perfect with k \le m.
Thus P(6) = 1/2.

In the following table are listed some values of P(m).
\begin{align}
P(5) &= 1/1\
P(10) &= 1/2\
P(15) &= 2/3\
P(20) &= 1/2\
P(25) &= 1/2\
P(30) &= 2/5\
\cdots &\
P(180) &= 1/4\
P(185) &= 3/13
\end{align}


Find the smallest m for which P(m) \lt 1/12345.
