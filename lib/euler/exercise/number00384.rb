Problem 384:

Define the sequence a(n) as the number of adjacent pairs of ones in the binary expansion of n (possibly overlapping).
E.g.: a(5) = a(101_2) = 0, a(6) = a(110_2) = 1, a(7) = a(111_2) = 2.

Define the sequence b(n) = (-1)^{a(n)}.
This sequence is called the Rudin-Shapiro sequence.
Also consider the summatory sequence of b(n): s(n) = \sum \limits_{i = 0}^n b(i).

The first couple of values of these sequences are:

n
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7

a(n)
0
0
0
1
0
0
1
2

b(n)
1
1
1
-1
1
1
-1
1

s(n)
1
2
3
2
3
4

4

The sequence s(n) has the remarkable property that all elements are positive and every positive integer k occurs exactly k times.

Define g(t,c), with 1 \le c \le t, as the index in s(n) for which t occurs for the c'th time in s(n).
E.g.: g(3,3) = 6, g(4,2) = 7 and g(54321,12345) = 1220847710.

Let F(n) be the Fibonacci sequence defined by:
F(0)=F(1)=1 and
F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) for n \gt 1.

Define GF(t)=g(F(t),F(t-1)).

Find \sum GF(t) for 2 \le t \le 45.
