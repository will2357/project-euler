Problem 634:

Define F(n) to be the number of integers xâ‰¤n that can be written in the form x=a^2b^3, where a and b are integers not necessarily different and both greater than 1.

For example, 32=2^2\times 2^3  and 72=3^2\times 2^3 are the only two integers less than 100 that can be written in this form. Hence, F(100)=2.

Further you are given F(2\times 10^4)=130 and F(3\times 10^6)=2014.

Find F(9\times 10^{18}).
