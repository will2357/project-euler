Problem 425:

Two positive numbers A and B are said to be connected (denoted by "A \leftrightarrow B") if one of these conditions holds:
(1) A and B have the same length and differ in exactly one digit; for example, 123 \leftrightarrow 173.
(2) Adding one digit to the left of A (or B) makes B (or A); for example, 23 \leftrightarrow 223 and 123 \leftrightarrow 23.

We call a prime P a 2's relative if there exists a chain of connected primes between 2 and P and no prime in the chain exceeds P.

For example, 127 is a 2's relative. One of the possible chains is shown below:
2 \leftrightarrow 3 \leftrightarrow 13 \leftrightarrow 113 \leftrightarrow 103 \leftrightarrow 107 \leftrightarrow 127
However, 11 and 103 are not 2's relatives.

Let F(N) be the sum of the primes \leq N which are not 2's relatives.
We can verify that F(10^3) = 431 and F(10^4) = 78728.

Find F(10^7).
