Problem 226:

The blancmange curve is the set of points (x, y) such that 0 \le x \le 1 and y = \sum \limits_{n = 0}^{\infty} {\dfrac{s(2^n x)}{2^n}}, where s(x) is the distance from x to the nearest integer.

The area under the blancmange curve is equal to Â½, shown in pink in the diagram below.

Let C be the circle with centre \left ( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2} \right ) and radius \frac{1}{4}, shown in black in the diagram.

What area under the blancmange curve is enclosed by C?Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places in the form 0.abcdefgh.
