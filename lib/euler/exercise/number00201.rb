Problem 201:

For any set  A  of numbers, let  \operatorname{sum}(A)  be the sum of the elements of  A .
Consider the set  B = \{1,3,6,8,10,11\} . There are  20  subsets of  B  containing three elements, and their sums are:

\begin{align}
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,3,6\})  = 10, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,3,8\})  = 12, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,3,10\})  = 14, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,3,11\})  = 15, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,6,8\})  = 15, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,6,10\})  = 17, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,6,11\})  = 18, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,8,10\})  = 19, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,8,11\})  = 20, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,10,11\})  = 22, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{3,6,8\})  = 17, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{3,6,10\})  = 19, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{3,6,11\})  = 20, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{3,8,10\})  = 21, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{3,8,11\})  = 22, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{3,10,11\})  = 24, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{6,8,10\})  = 24, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{6,8,11\})  = 25, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{6,10,11\})  = 27, 
\operatorname{sum}(\{8,10,11\})  = 29.
\end{align}

Some of these sums occur more than once, others are unique.
For a set  A , let  U(A,k)  be the set of unique sums of  k -element subsets of  A , in our example we find  U(B,3) = \{10,12,14,18,21,25,27,29\}  and  \operatorname{sum}(U(B,3)) = 156 .

Now consider the  100 -element set  S = \{1^2, 2^2, ..., 100^2\} .
S has  100891344545564193334812497256   50 -element subsets.

Determine the sum of all integers which are the sum of exactly one of the  50 -element subsets of  S , i.e. find  \operatorname{sum}(U(S,50)) .
